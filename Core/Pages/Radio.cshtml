                <p>"What? Are you listening radio? In 21st century?? What's wrong with you???"<br>
                You see, my dear friends, for me - radio is not just a random background music, which usually plays in cars. Oh no. Radio - is the whole world, opened for you without any internet connection or other advanced networking. </p>
                <p>And speaking about "whole world" - I mean not FM radio stations, but rather AM and, especially <a class="underline hover:no-underline" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_listening">SW stations</a>, which literally broadcast for every corner of our planet.</p>
                <p>Short waves are really a pure magic. You can listen both <a class="underline hover:no-underline" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio">radio enthusiasts</a> or official short-waves broadcasters from the whole world right from your home, and all you need for this - is just your radio!</p>
                <p>If you'd like - you could be just an advanced <a class="underline hover:no-underline" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DXing">DXer</a>, of even more - you can send a <a class="underline hover:no-underline" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SINPO_code">SINPO</a> report and obtain a <a class="underline hover:no-underline" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SINPO_code">QSL card</a> in exchange!</p>
                <p>Hell yeah, you can be a part of this 100-year community as well. And all you need for this, once again - it's just a regular SW-radio. And that's it.</p>
                <p>I began to be a part of this movement back in 2016. I received a lot of QSL-cards, gifts and postcards from 
                    <a class="underline hover:no-underline" target="_blank" href="https://world.kbs.co.kr/service/index.htm?lang=e">KBS World Radio</a>, 
                    <a class="underline hover:no-underline" target="_blank" href="https://enrsi.rtvs.sk/">RSI</a>, 
                    <a class="underline hover:no-underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.rri.ro/en">RRI</a>, 
                    <a class="underline hover:no-underline" target="_blank" href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/">NHK WORLD</a>. 
                    Once I'd been giving an 30 mins interview for a journalist, who called me right from Seoul. And the only thing I did for all of these things - I was just listening the radio.</p>
                <p>It's the whole world. Yet unknown, maybe, and pretty difficult followed, but the more captivating it is.</p>
                <p>Below you can find several links to the resources, which will help you to dive in this astonishing world.</p>
                <p>Also - there are some links to the recent episodes of overview of the radio world, made by <a class="underline hover:no-underline" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Hauser">Glenn Hauser</a> - a man, who dedicated all his life to amateur SW-radio brodcasting and DX-ing. He's doing this podcast for decades, and is doing it damn good.</p>
